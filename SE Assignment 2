1. Define SE
   >>> Is a systematic approach which accompany principle of engineering application methods to use tools and develop software systems of high-quality.

2. What is SE, and how does it differ from traditional programming programming?
   >>> SD = Developers do the small-scale work, completing a program that performs a specific function of set of functions.

   >>> SE = Engineering/engineers put many programs together to make sure they all work correctly

3. Difference between SE and SD? 
   >>> The difference engineers and developers it begins with a job function:
                                - Engineers are leaders they lead or channel developer the right perspective about the project
                                - Developers they carry out the mandate given by engineers to execute them

4. Phases of SDLC
    >>> Requirement of gathering and analysis 
    >>> Design
    >>> Implementation or Coding
    >>> Testing
    >>> Deployment 
    >>> Maintenance

     - Requirement of gathering and analysis 
       All the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a pproduct as per their expectation

     - Design
       The requirement gathering in the SRS document is used as an important and software archtecture that is used for implementing system development is derived.

     - Implementation or Coding
       implementation / Coding starts once the developer gets the design document.The software design is translated into source code. All  the components of the software are implemented in this phase.

     - Testing
       Testing starts once the coding is complete and the modules are released for testing. In this phase, the developed software is testing thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed.

     - Deployment
       Once the product is tested, it is deployed in the production environment or first UAT { User Acceptance Testing } is done depending on the customer expectation

     - Maintenance
       After the deployment of a production on the production environment, maintenance of the product i.e id any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers.

5. What is Waterfall?
   - The waterfall project management method is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline. It involves rigorous planning upfront to ensure that the project stays on track, with progress tracked closely and issues addressed promptlyl. Waterfall model usually includes fire project management stages
               { Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring control }

      While this approach is effective for straightforward projects that require minimal adaptation or creativity, it may not be suitable for more complex initiatives that demand a more flexible and dynamic approach.

    > What is Agile?
    - Agile project management is a flexible and alterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high-quality results within shorter timeframes. It's often used in SD.

      Agile methodologies are about teamwork, customer satisfaction, constant refinement, and breaking big projects into bite-sized pieces.

      Differences between Waterfall & Agile

        - Role
                > Waterfall strictly assigns roles to project team members, with specific duties and responsibilities defined for each team member

                > In contrast, the Agile model empower team member to collaboration on different aspects of the project over time, leading to a more self-organizing team structure.


         - Planning 
                 > In Waterfall, planning is a linear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirements and objectives laid out in detail upfront.

                  > Agile planning is a continuous process throughout the project's life cycle, with adjustments made as new information or requirement emerges.

          - Scope
                  > The waterfall methodology generally discourages changes to the project scope, even with change requests used correctly. This is because the methodology requires an extensive amount of time spent in the beginning trying to get the plan right, which can 
                                       make changes more costly after the project has began.

                   > Agile is more adaptable to changes in scope, with the development team able to adjust quickly as requirements changes

           - Time frames
                   > Waterfall method is designed for long-term project with predetermined timeline. 
                      The project is completed linearly, with each phase depart
